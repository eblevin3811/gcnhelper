Plenty of projects similar to this exist for other entries in the Animal Crossing series, but one has not yet been made (to my knowledge) for Animal Crossing (GCN).

This project serves as a companion tool for that game specifically. It aims to help players keep track of their completion of the game's many item lists/creature catalogs, as well as find out how to obtain certain items or creatures.

This is a passion project and is being created for free.
